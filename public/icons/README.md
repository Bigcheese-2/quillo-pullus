# PWA Icons

This directory should contain the following PWA icons:

- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels (for home screen on mobile)
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels (for splash screen and high-res displays)

## Generating Icons

You can generate these icons using:
1. Online tools like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Image editing software (export at correct sizes)
3. Create a simple colored square with text for now

For development, you can create simple placeholder icons. The app will work without them, but they're required for a proper PWA installation experience.
